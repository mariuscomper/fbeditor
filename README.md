# Offline HTML5 Text & Code Editor

A lightweight, zero-dependency, offline-first HTML editor that runs entirely in your browser. This single-file application provides a clean, split-screen interface with a source code editor and a live WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) preview pane.

It's designed for simplicity, speed, and convenience, allowing you to create and edit HTML content without needing an internet connection or complex software.
