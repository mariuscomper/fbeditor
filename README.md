# Offline HTML5 Text & Code Editor

A lightweight, zero-dependency, offline-first HTML editor that runs entirely in your browser. This single-file application provides a clean, split-screen interface with a source code editor and a live WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) preview pane.

It's designed for simplicity, speed, and convenience, allowing you to create and edit HTML content without needing an internet connection or complex software.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Works Offline:** The entire editor is a single `.html` file. Save it to your computer and use it anywhere, anytime.
* **Live WYSIWYG Editing:** See your rendered HTML update in real-time as you type. The preview pane is also directly editable, with changes syncing back to the source code.
* **File Management:** Create new documents, open existing `.html` files from your computer, and save your work locally.
* **Powerful Editing & Formatting Tools:**
    * **Text Case Converter:** Instantly change selected text to **Sentence case**, **lowercase**, **UPPERCASE**, or **Title Case**.
    * **Smart Paste:** Automatically detects when a URL is pasted and places it in the URL utility field instead of the main text body, streamlining your workflow.
    * **Code & Text Cleaning:** Tidy up messy code, apply consistent formatting, convert HTML entities, and reformat line breaks into proper paragraphs.
    * **Smart Capitalization:** Automatically capitalize hundreds of common acronyms (e.g., NASA, HTML, CEO).
* **Integrated URL Utilities:**
    * **Social Sharing:** A dedicated field and button to quickly share an article URL on Facebook.
    * **Archive.ph Link Generator:** Instantly create a clean, permanent `archive.ph` link from a URL, stripping away tracking parameters.
* **Customizable Interface:**
    * **Adjustable Font Size:** Increase or decrease the font size in the source editor for better readability.
    * **Toggleable Preview:** Hide the preview pane to focus entirely on the source code.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Speed up your workflow with shortcuts for **Save** (`Ctrl+S`), **New** (`Ctrl+N`), **Clean HTML** (`Ctrl+Shift+C`), and **Wrap Quotes** (`Ctrl+Shift+Q`).
* **Safety First:** The editor warns you if you try to create a new document with unsaved changes.
* **No Dependencies:** No servers, no build steps, no installations. It just works.
